## What's Next?
Following is the to-do list for all of the Toolshed libraries:
 - Ensure comments are in place (because Intellisense is the best thing ever)
 - Better workflow (maybe.). Currently, I commit to GitHub, myGet picks this up and builds, then I go to myGet and push to Nuget.
 - Find a way for myGet (which is what I use to build the NuGet package) to get the versioning from the project itself instead of manually having to update when I push.
 - Add overrides or optional parameters for culture sensitive methods (think dates)
 - Make the website better
 - While reading code is definite documentation and this type of library is even easier to read than some app, I would like to have an overall list or grouping of expected methods - can this library help you?
 - Testing. Yes, long overdue, but I can admit it. This needs testing

## History - Used this before?
If you used any of the toolshed libraries before, this is the latest version. With a bunch of cleaning, tidying up and refactoring. Read more about it above.
